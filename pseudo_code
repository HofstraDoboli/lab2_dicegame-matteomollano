Declare die1 and die2 variables
Declare a die sum variable which stores the sum of die1 and die2
Declare a player's points variable that stores value of the die sum when you do not
roll a 7, 11, 2, 3, or 12.

Create a play game loop:
Initialize a character variable named start_game
Display a question asking the user if they want to play
Receive user input from the player using the start_game character variable

WHILE the user input is either Y or y, start game
    Initialize your two dice (die1 and die2) that store random values between 1 and 6
    Initialize your die sum variable that stores the addition of die1 and die2 variables

    IF the sum of the dice is equal to 7 or 11
        Display a message saying "The sum of your roll is ", followed by the value
        stored in die sum, followed by ". Congratulations, You Win!"
        Set the start_game variable to 'N' to temporarily stop the game
        Display a message asking the user if they want to play again
        Receive user input using the start_game character variable
    
    ELSE IF the sum of the dice is equal to either 2, 3, or 12
        Display a message that saying "The sum of your roll is", followed by the
        value stored in die sum, followed by ". Sorry, you lose."
        Set the start_game variable to 'N' to temporarily stop the game
        Display a message asking the user if they want to play again
        Receive user input using the start_game character variable
    
    ELSE
        Display a message "The sum of your roll is " followed by the value stored in
        die sum
        Initialize a new char variable called new_roll that which allows you to roll
        the 2 dice again
        Display a message asking the user to press S to roll the dice again
        Receive user input using the new_roll character variable

        Create a new loop:

        WHILE the user input is S or s, start the new roll
            Set the player's points to the value stored in die sum
            Reinitialize your die1 and die2 variables
            Initialize a new variable called new_die_sum which will store the sum of
            die1 and die2 from the new roll that takes place

            IF the new die sum is equal to the player's points
                Display the player's points
                Display the sum of your new role (new die sum)
                Display a message saying "Congratulations, You Win!"
                Ask the user if they would like to play again
                Receive input from the user through the start_game character variable

            ELSE IF the new die sum is equal to 7
                Display the player's points
                Display the sum of your new role (new die sum)
                Display a message saying "Sorry, you lose."
                Ask the user if they would like to play again
                Receive input from the user through the start_game character variable

            ELSE
                Display the player's points
                Display the sum of your new role (new die sum)
                Display a message telling the user to press S to roll again
                Receive input from the user through the new roll character variable
                The program will continue to roll again until either the value of the
                new roll is equal to the player's points, in which the player wins,
                or the value of the new roll is equal to 7, in which the player loses
