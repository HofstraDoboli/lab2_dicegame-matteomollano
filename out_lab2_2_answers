Q1: (cin only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q1: I entered 10 and the flag is false, and it displayed the value 10. But when I entered 4.5, 
 it says the flag is still false and it extracts 4, and it continues the loop without accepting any other values.

Q2: (cin + fail+ignore) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q2: I entered 10 and it set the fail flag to false, then I entered 4.5 and it set the fail flag to false, 
 but it shows .5 in the buffer. For abc and a, it sets the fail flag to true and explains that it is not an integer.

Q3: Is the problem of reading an integer value solved? Explain your reasoning.
Answer Q3: No, because for 4.5, it set the flag to false and it extracted 4 without saying it is not an integer.

Q4: (getline only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q4: I entered 10 and it displays the value 10, then I entered 4.5 and it displays the value 4. 
 Then I entered abc and the program terminates with an error thrown by the stoi function.

Q5: (getline+stoi) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q5: This code does the same thing as the code in question 4, however, when you enter abc, 
 the error that is thrown by the code is caught using the try and catch block function. 
 This stoi invalid argument error is then displayed to the screen, but the program does not terminate. 
 It doesn't extract abc, so it skips a and 4, and it doesn't change the value stored in val.

Q6: Explain your method to validate integer values entered.
Answer Q6: In order to validate integer values entered, the value 10 needs to be seen as an integer, 
 while the rest of the values (4.5, abc, and a) must be flagged as not an integer and the program doesn't terminate.
